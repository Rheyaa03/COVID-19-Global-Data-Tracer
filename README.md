# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracer
In this project, I built a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app)  that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. I cleaned and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.
