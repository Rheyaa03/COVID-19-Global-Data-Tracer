# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracer
In this project, I built a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app)  that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. I cleaned and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools. 

# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries. The goal is to visualize the data and generate insights using Python, primarily with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations.
- Visualize trends with various charts and graphs.
- Generate insights based on the analysis.
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook format, including visuals and narrative explanations.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have a `requirements.txt` file).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells in order.

## Insights and Reflections
This project helps us understand the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, track vaccination progress, and identify countries with the highest numbers of cases and deaths.
